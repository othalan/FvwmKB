2012/03/11:
  - Update Makefile for FVWM link, however it does not load in Python
2012/03/11:
  - Project State Unknown - No serious development in years.
  - Added files for Requirements, Design, and Development Status to help track
    changes in the future when work comes to a halt.
  - Consider finding an mechanism for Requirements tracking
  - Consider setting up an online bug tracker
  - Steps to resume progress:
    - FVWM: Setup fvwm running as an alternate window manager
    - COMM: Python module communicating with fvwm, no packet format parsing
    - TEST: Setup a test suite to be used for any tests that can be automated
    - SWIG: investigate state of the fvwm automated interface
      - Determine which data structures are needed for basic functionality and
        if they are currently available
      - Add missing data structures _only_ if they are needed for the current
        stage of development!
