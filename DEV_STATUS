2012/03/11:
  - Compiling and loading in Python2.7
  - Pybit references commented out because that library is broken -- Need
    something new!
  - Modify the swig interface to include module constants
  - Do an initial port to Python3.2
    - Module code ports cleanly
    - Requires Xlib library for Python3.2, which is not yet available
      - Port of Xlib library to Python3.2 was smooth, however it uses the 'new'
        library which has been removed in 3.x  Needs more work (and feed changes
        back to the developers!)
2012/03/11:
  - Update Makefile for FVWM link, however it does not load in Python
2012/03/11:
  - Project State Unknown - No serious development in years.
  - Added files for Requirements, Design, and Development Status to help track
    changes in the future when work comes to a halt.
  - Consider finding an mechanism for Requirements tracking
  - Consider setting up an online bug tracker
  - Steps to resume progress:
    - FVWM: Setup fvwm running as an alternate window manager
    - COMM: Python module communicating with fvwm, no packet format parsing
    - TEST: Setup a test suite to be used for any tests that can be automated
    - SWIG: investigate state of the fvwm automated interface
      - Determine which data structures are needed for basic functionality and
        if they are currently available
      - Add missing data structures _only_ if they are needed for the current
        stage of development!
